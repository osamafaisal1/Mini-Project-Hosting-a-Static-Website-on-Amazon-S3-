🚀 Mini Project: Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3

Today, I completed my first mini project on AWS by hosting a static website using Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).

Here’s how I did it step by step:

🔹 Step 1: Created a new S3 bucket (osama-cloud-s3) with a unique name.
 🔹 Step 2: Enabled “Static Website Hosting” in bucket properties.
 🔹 Step 3: Uploaded simple index.html and error.html files.
 🔹 Step 4: Configured bucket policy to allow public access for website files.
 🔹 Step 5: Copied the S3 website endpoint URL and accessed my hosted site 🎉

✅ Now my basic static website is live directly from the cloud without any server!

👉 Next, I’ll be exploring IAM roles and permissions to securely manage access to AWS resources.
